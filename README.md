Code for Students
=================

A repository of example code created for my students by request or as inspiration.

Writing example code for individual students is something I spend a decent amount of time doing during the school year. However, I've only recently come to the (now obvious) conclusion that it would probably be useful to others as well.

As for the code, I will typically favor simplicity (descriptive variable and function names, verbose comparisons in conditional statements, heavy use of comments, etc.) over elegance, but it will often be dependent on the ability of the student that the code was originally intended for.

Let me know if you find this useful!
